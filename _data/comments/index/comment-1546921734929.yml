message: "First of all I would like to say wonderful blog!\r\nI had a quick question which I'd like to ask if you don't mind.\r\nI was interested to find out how you center yourself \r\nand clear your head prior to writing. I have had a \r\nhard time clearing my mind in getting my thoughts out.\r\nI truly do enjoy writing but it just seems like the first 10 to 15 minutes are usually wasted simply just trying to figure out how to begin. Any suggestions or \r\nhints? Appreciate it!"
